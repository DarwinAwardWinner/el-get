# Task hierarchy

This rewrite is happening from the bottom up, so things need to be
written in a certain order before other higher layers can be written.

* Install Methods
* Recipe I/O
* Recipe transformers (virtual install methods)
* Async package fetching (just file method first, I guess)
* Async package unpacking
* Async package installation
* Async package building
* Async package init in batch emacs (for verifying successful install)
